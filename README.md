# libQuestMR

Unofficial library that handles the communication with the Quest 2 for mixed reality and provides an easy bridge to OpenCV.  
Still a work in progress. Already usable but the interface may change a lot in future versions.  
A mixed reality capture software is on development [here](https://github.com/RandomPrototypes/RPMixedRealityCapture).

### Credits
A part of the code is based on the official [OBS plugin for Quest 2](https://github.com/facebookincubator/obs-plugins).  
Most of the rest of the code is based on wireshark captures and a little bit of reading of the code of [RealityMixer](https://github.com/fabio914/RealityMixer)
